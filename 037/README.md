The cjam works this way

```
1e4{         loops from 0 to 1e4 
             â€” it could be anything, but the performances would go down :-)
  S          S is initialized to ' '
  I+         concats I to S
  :S         assigns the new string to S
  ;          pops the string from the stack
}fI          f is for, I is the variable
S1>          slice S from position 1, removing ' 0'
s            converts S to a string (it is necessary, for some reason)
r#           finds the index of the argument and puts it in the stack
```
