Challenge #38: How Even is a Number

The ancient Greeks had these things called singly and doubly even numbers. An example of a singly even number is 14. It can be divided by 2 once, and has at that point become an odd number (7), after which it is not divisible by 2 anymore. A doubly even number is 20. It can be divided by 2 twice, and then becomes 5.

Your task is to write a function or program that takes an integer as input, and outputs the number of times it is divisible by 2 as an integer, in as few bytes as possible.


Test cases:

```
14 -> 1

20 -> 2

94208 -> 12

7 -> 0

-4 -> 2
```

The Rules

- Your program may accept input over STDIN or ARGV
- Your program should print the output to STDOUT or equivalent
- The number of divisions should be the only output. Trailing whitespace is acceptable.
- The input will be a nonzero integer (any positive or negative value, within the limits of your language).
- This code golf, so lowest number of bytes wins!
